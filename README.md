# Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

**Project Overview**

    This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Using the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the model categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. The ultimate goal is to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, thereby improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

**Problem Statement**

    In this project, you assume the role of a data scientist at Microsoft tasked with enhancing the SOCs' efficiency. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents using the GUIDE dataset. The model will categorize incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP). The performance of the model will be evaluated based on macro-F1 score, precision, and recall, ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data and is reliable for real-world applications.

**Business Use Cases**

The solution developed in this project can be applied to various cybersecurity scenarios, such as:

1. Security Operation Centers (SOCs): Automating the triage process to classify cybersecurity incidents accurately, allowing SOC analysts to prioritize critical threats more efficiently.

2. Incident Response Automation: Enabling guided response systems to automatically suggest appropriate actions for different types of incidents, leading to quicker mitigation of potential threats.

3. Threat Intelligence: Enhancing threat detection by incorporating historical evidence and customer responses into the triage process, leading to more accurate identification of true and false positives.

4. Enterprise Security Management: Improving the overall security posture by reducing false positives and ensuring prompt action on true threats.

**Approach**

1. Data Exploration and Understanding
Initial Inspection: Load and inspect the train.csv dataset to understand its structure, including feature types and target variable distribution.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies. Pay special attention to class imbalances.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Address missing values through imputation, removal, or using models that handle missing data.
Feature Engineering: Create or modify features to improve model performance, such as deriving new features from timestamps or normalizing numerical variables.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. Data Splitting
Train-Validation Split: Split the data into training and validation sets, typically using a 70-30 or 80-20 split. Use stratified sampling if the target variable is imbalanced.

5. Model Selection and Training
Baseline Model: Start with a simple baseline model like logistic regression or decision trees.
Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance and reduce overfitting risks.

6. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Handling Class Imbalance: Use techniques like SMOTE, adjusting class weights, or ensemble methods to address class imbalance.

7. Model Interpretation
Feature Importance: Analyze which features contribute most to predictions using methods like SHAP values or permutation importance.
Error Analysis: Identify common misclassifications for further model refinement.
